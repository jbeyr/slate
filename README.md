# Slant


![](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/jameesyy/slate)

Slate is a hacked client for Minecraft 1.8.9 built with closet-cheating modules and miscellaneous QoL features.
</div>

# Installation
Slant is standalone with dependents baked in and distributed as a `.jar` file. Just [download the latest release](https://github.com/jameesyy/slant/releases) and put it in your `./minecraft/mods/` folder.

# Features
- **Anti Bot**: detects and ignores spoofed players that are fabricated by anticheats.
- **Aim Assist**: aims your camera towards target entities.
- **Autoclicker**: Clicks the mouse for you when holding down the respective button.
- **Auto Ghead**: swaps your hotbar slot to a healing item and consumes it, when below a certain health threshold.
- **Auto Jump Reset**: jumps the moment you take damage and knockback from other players, substantially reducing received knockback.
- **Auto Tool**: swaps to the tool that mines the block you're trying to break the fastest.
- **Auto Weapon**: swaps to the leftmost slot with a weapon in your hotbar.
- **Backtrack**: lag-based reach module that delays the velocity of other players so they don't go out of range
- **Blockhit**: automatically blockhits when you attack with your sword.
- **Bridge Assist**: dynamically toggles the sneak button for the player as they're bridging so they don't fall off a ledge or into the void.
- **Delay Remover**: removes the vanilla attack, mining, and jump cooldown that occurs when you miss clicks, mine a block, and jump respectively.
- **ESP**: renders hitboxes on players; particularly useful for invisibles and certain blocks.
  - **Shark ESP**: renders hitboxes for players below a certain health threshold.
  - **Bed ESP**: renders beds through walls.
  - **Invis ESP**: specific render module for players with invisibility. 
- **Ping Spoofer**: a lag switch that throttles inbound and outbound packets for an extended latency offset
- **Pointers**: renders an arrow at entities, such as fireballs.


All of the modules above are configurable to provide substantial advantages while preserving enough subtlety to evade anticheat and staff bans.

# FAQ
### Why no [blatant feature here]?
Slate is not a blatant client. You won't see modules in the same vein as bhop, killaura, or velocity.
There are plans for a silentaura module in the future, but it will take time.
