Standalone source installation
==============================
1. Open your command-line and browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.
2. "./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace"
3. "./gradlew genIntellijRuns"

If you do not care about seeing Minecraft's source code you can replace "setupDecompWorkspace" with one of the following:
"setupDevWorkspace": Will patch, deobfusicated, and gather required assets to run minecraft, but will not generated human readable source code.
"setupCIWorkspace": Same as Dev but will not download any assets. This is useful in build servers as it is the fastest because it does the least work.

When using Decomp workspace, the Minecraft source code is NOT added to your workspace in a editable way. Minecraft is treated like a normal Library. Sources are there for documentation and research purposes and usually can be accessed under the 'referenced libraries' section of your IDE.
